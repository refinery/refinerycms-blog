Feature: Blog Post Authors
  Blog posts can be assigned authors through the given user model
  current_user is assumed through admin screens

  Scenario: Saving a blog post in blog_posts#new associates the current_user as the author
    Given I am a logged in refinery user

    When I am on the new blog post form
    And I fill in "Title" with "This is my blog post"
    And I fill in "blog_post_body_source" with "And I love it"
    And I press "Save"

    Then there should be 1 blog post
    And the blog post should belong to me
